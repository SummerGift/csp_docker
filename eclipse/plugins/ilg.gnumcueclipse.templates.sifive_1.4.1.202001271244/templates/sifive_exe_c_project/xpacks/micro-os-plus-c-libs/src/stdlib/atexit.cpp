/**
 * @brief Request execution of functions at program exit.
 * @param fn
 * @retval 0 The call succeeded in enrolling the function.
 * @retval -1 The call failed, possibly due to memory problems.
 *
 * @details
 * `atexit()` can be used to enroll functions in a list of functions that
 * will be called when the program terminates normally.  The argument is
 * a pointer to a user-defined function (which must not require arguments and
 * must not return a result).
 *
 * The functions are kept in a LIFO stack; that is, the last function
 * enrolled by `atexit()` will be the first to execute when the program
 * exits.
 *
 * The ANSI standard specifies that
 * there is no built-in limit to the number of functions that can be enrolled
 * in this list; however, after every group of 32 functions is enrolled,
 * `atexit()` will call `malloc()` to get space for the next part of the
 * list.   The initial list of 32 functions is statically allocated, so
 * you can always count on at least that many slots available.
 *
 * To minimise RAM consumption and to avoid the use of dynamic
 * memory allocations, the above requirement is not met; instead
 * a static array of pointers is used; each application can customise the
 * size of this array to match its needs.
