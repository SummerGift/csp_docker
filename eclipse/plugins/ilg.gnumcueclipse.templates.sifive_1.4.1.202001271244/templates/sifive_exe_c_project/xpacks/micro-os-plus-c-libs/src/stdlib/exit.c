 *
 * - calls all application-defined cleanup functions enrolled with `atexit()`;
 * - files and streams are
 * cleaned up: any pending output is delivered to the host system, each
 * open file or stream is closed, and files created by `tmpfile()` are
 * deleted (wishful thinking, not implemented);
 * - call the static destructors (in reverse order of constructors)
 *
 * When all cleanups are done, `_Exit()` is called to perform
 * the actual termination.
